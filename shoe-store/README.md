<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, Responsive Tools</p>
<br>
<p>
I built this website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and JQuery.

- HTML5 provided the structure and content for the website
- CSS3 was used to style and layout the website
- JavaScript was used to create interactive features such as the navigation bar and form validation.
- JQuery added some functionality when it came to styling and responsiveness.

I also used a responsive design approach to ensure the website looks great on all devices.</p>
<br>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>Here are some ways that I could increase performance on my website:

I could have:
- Minified and compressed all CSS and JavaScript files to reduce load times
- Optimized all images by reducing their file size and using the correct image formats
- Implemented lazy loading for images to only load them when they are in the viewport
- Used a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets from multiple locations
- Leveraged browser caching to improve page load time for repeat visitors
- Used Google PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix, etc. to measure and analyze website performance and identify opportunities for optimization.

Silverpoint Sneakers is a pretty light webpage, so I did not find it necessary to do any of these things. The page loads fine on any computer or device that I have tested it on.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Building Silverpoint Sneakers was a great learning experience and I took away several valuable lessons:

- The importance of planning and organization in the development process
- The power of CSS Grid and Flexbox in creating responsive and flexible layouts
- The importance of performance optimization and website accessibility
- The importance of testing and debugging in the development process
- The significance of keeping up with the latest web development technologies and trends
- The benefit of using version control with Git and hosting the code on Github</p>
